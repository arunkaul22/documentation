Fiscal certification: POS restaurant
====================================

In Belgium, the owner of a cooking business such as a restaurant or food truck is required by law to
use a government-certified **Cash Register System** for their receipts. This applies if their yearly
earnings (excluding VAT, drinks, and take-away food) exceed 25,000 euros.

This government-certified system entails the use of a :ref:`certified POS system
<belgium/certified>`, along with a device called a :ref:`Fiscal Data Module <belgium/fdm>` (or
**black box**) and a :ref:`VAT Signing Card <belgium/vat>`.

.. important::
   Do not forget to register as *foodservice industry manager* on the `Service Public Federal
   Finances <https://www.systemedecaisseenregistreuse.be/fr/enregistrement>`__ website.

Certified POS system
--------------------

The Odoo POS system is certified for the three latest major versions of databases hosted on **Odoo
Online** and **Odoo.sh**. Please refer to the following table to ensure that your POS system is
certified.

+---------------+--------------------+--------------------+----------------+
|               |   **Odoo Online**  |     **Odoo.sh**    | **On-Premise** |
+===============+====================+====================+================+
| **Odoo 16.0** | Review in progress | Review in progress | Not certified  |
+---------------+--------------------+--------------------+----------------+
| Odoo 15.2     | Not certified      | Not certified      | Not certified  |
+---------------+--------------------+--------------------+----------------+
| **Odoo 15.0** | Certified          | Certified          | Not certified  |

| **Odoo 14.0** | Certified          | Certified          | Not certified  |
+---------------+--------------------+--------------------+----------------+

A `certified POS system <https://www.systemedecaisseenregistreuse.be/systemes-certifies>`_ must
adhere to rigorous government regulations, which means it operates differently from a non-certified
POS.

- On a certified POS, you cannot:

  - Make a refund.
  - Set up and use the **global discounts** feature (the `pos_discount` module is blacklisted and
    cannot be activated).
  - Set up and use the **loyalty programs** feature (the `pos_loyalty` module is blacklisted and
    cannot be activated).
  - Reprint receipts (the `pos_reprint` module is blacklisted and cannot be activated).
  - Modify prices in order lines.
  - Modify or delete order lines in POS orders.
  - Sell products without a valid VAT number.
  - Use a POS that is not connected to an IoT box.

- The :doc:`cash rounding <../../sales/point_of_sale/shop/cash_rounding>` feature must be
  activated and set to a :guilabel:`Rounding Precision` of `0,05` and a :guilabel:`Rounding Method`
  set as :guilabel:`Half-Up`.
- Taxes must be set as included in the price. To set it up, go to :menuselection:`Point of Sale -->
  Configuration --> Settings --> Taxes section --> External link --> Advanced Options` and enable
  :guilabel:`Included in Price`.
- At the start of a POS session, users must click :guilabel:`Work in` to clock in. Doing so allows
  the registration of POS orders. If users are not clocked in, they cannot make POS orders.
  Likewise, they must click :guilabel:`Work Out` to clock out at the end of the session.

.. warning::
   If you configure a POS to work with a black box, you cannot use it again without it.

On-premise
~~~~~~~~~~

Using the module from its source or a modified version **cannot** be certified. The Fiscal Data
Module is supported for on-premise users, but using it requires an obfuscated version of the
`pos_blackbox_be` module, which is only available upon request for Enterprise customers.

.. _belgium/fdm:

The Fiscal Data Module
----------------------

The :abbr:`FDM (Fiscal Data Module)`, or `black box
<https://www.xn--botenoire-r5a.be/fonctionnement>`_, is a government-certified device
that works together with the Point of Sale application and saves your POS orders information.
Concretely, a **hash** (:dfn:`unique code`) is generated for each POS order and added to its
receipt. This allows the government to verify that all revenue is declared.

.. note::
   Ensure your black box is approved by the Belgian government. You can check the compliance of your
   black box by visiting the `Service Public Federal Finances
   <https://www.systemedecaisseenregistreuse.be/systemes-certifies#FDM%20certifi%C3%A9s>`__
   website.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before setting up your database to work with an FDM, ensure you have the following hardware:

- a registered :ref:`black box <belgium/blackbox>` (go to `www.boîtenoire.be
  <https://www.xn--botenoire-r5a.be/ma-caisse/>`_ to order yours);
- a serial null modem cable per FDM (`example
  <https://www.startech.com/Cables/Serial-Parallel-PS-2/DB9-DB25/10-ft-Cross-Wired-Serial-Null-Modem-Cable-DB9-FM~SCNM9FM>`__);
- a serial-to-USB adapter per FDM (`example
  <https://trendnet.com/products/proddetail.asp?prod=265_TU-S9>`__); and
- An :ref:`IoT Box <belgium/iotbox>` (one IoT box per black box);
- A receipt printer.

.. _belgium/blackbox:

Black box
*********

As a pre-requisite, activate the **black box module**. To do so, go to the :guilabel:`Apps`
application, remove the :guilabel:`Apps` filter, search for the `Belgian Registered Cash Register`
module (technical name: `pos_blackbox_be`), and click :guilabel:`Activate`.

.. image:: belgium/be-modules.png

Once the module is activated, update your company info with your VAT number. To set it up, go to
:menuselection:`Settings --> Companies --> Update Info`, and fill in the :guilabel:`VAT` field.
Then, enter a national registration number for every staff member who operates the POS system. To do
so, go to the :guilabel:`Employees` app and open an employee form. After that, go to the
:menuselection:`HR settings tab --> Attendance`, and fill in the :guilabel:`INSZ or BIS number`
field.

.. tip::
   To input your information, click on your avatar, go to :menuselection:`My Profile --> Preference
   tab`, and enter your INSZ or BIS number in the designated field.

.. warning::
   Configuring the black box directly in the production database is essential, as utilizing it in a
   testing environment may result in incorrect data being stored within the black box.

.. _belgium/iotbox:

IoT Box
*******

In order to use a Fiscal Data Module, you need a registered IoT Box. To register your IoT box, you
must contact us through our `contact form <https://www.odoo.com/help>`_ and provide the following
information:

- your VAT number;
- your company's name, address, and legal structure; and
- the Mac address of your IoT Box.

Once your IoT box is certified, :doc:`connect <../../productivity/iot/config/connect>` it to your
database. To verify that the IoT Box recognizes the FDM, go to the IoT homepage and scroll down the
:guilabel:`IOT Device` section, which should display the FDM.

.. image:: belgium/iot-devices.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Hardware status page on a registered IoT Box

Then, add the IoT to your POS. To do so, go to :menuselection:`Point of Sale --> Configuration -->
Point of Sale`, select your POS, scroll down to the :guilabel:`Connected Device` section, and enable
:guilabel:`IoT Box`. Lastly, add the FMD in the :guilabel:`Fiscal Data Module` field.

.. note::
   To be able to use an FDM, you must at least connect a :guilabel:`Receipt Printer`.

.. _belgium/vat:

VAT signing card
----------------

When you open a POS session and make your initial transaction, you are prompted to enter the PIN
provided with your :abbr:`VSC (VAT signing card)`. The card is delivered by the :abbr:`FPS (Service
Public Federal Finances)` upon `registration <https://www.systemedecaisseenregistreuse.be/fr/enregistrement>`_.
