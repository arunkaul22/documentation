Connect a Camera
================

A camera can be used when using the *IoT Box* with an Odoo database. It can be added in a
few easy steps. Then, it can be used in a manufacturing process and it can be linked to a control
point. Doing so will allow for the taking of pictures when a chosen quality control point has been
reached.

Connection
==========

To connect the camera to the *IoT Box*, simply connect the two by cable. This is likely a USB cable.

If the camera is a `supported one <https://www.odoo.com/page/iot-hardware>`__, there is no need to
set up anything as it will be detected as soon as it is connected.

Link a Camera to a quality control point within a manufacturing process
=======================================================================

In the :menuselection:`Quality app`, a device can be setup on a *Quality Control Point*. Go to the
:menuselection:`Control Points --> Quality Control` and open the control point which will be linked
with the camera.

Now, edit the control point and choose the device from the dropdown list. The changes will
automatically save when navigating away from the page with the changes.

The camera can be used with the selected *Control Point*. When the *Quality Control Point* is
reached during the manufacturing process the database will prompt the operator to take a picture.
